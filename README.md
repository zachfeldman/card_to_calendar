# card_to_calendar

This is a Chrome extension built because, wait, if there's a Google Now card for my flight - shouldn't I be able to add it to my calendar?!

I have no idea if this will work in anybody else's Gmail or if Google will change the class names I used to access the data. There may be a more reliable way to parse the data from the page and I'm open to hearing about it.

Pull requests welcome!
